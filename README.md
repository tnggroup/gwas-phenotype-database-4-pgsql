# gwas-phenotype-database-4-pgsql (PhenoDB for short)
A relational database structure in PostgreSQL for managing phenotypic data from multiple GWAS projects.

This database structure was primarily created to be used internally by the TNG group, possibly by the PGD ED group, and later the COVID-CNS project but can of course be used elsewhere.

There is no publication describing the database so far, but please acknowledge the work if you use the software.

For instructions on how to use the database, see the [wiki](https://github.com/tnggroup/gwas-phenotype-database-4-pgsql/wiki).
